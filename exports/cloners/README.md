## Cloners

Cloners clone and declone Pokemon.

A glitch species is a cloner if its name overwrites inBoxMovingMode to a value other than 0, 1, or 2.

Cloning will leave behind an artifact, usually a bad egg or an invisible bad egg. Both will occupy a box slot but can be decloned.

Most cloners softlock the Move Items cursor when the cursor passes over them.

### Cloning

1. Place the white glove over a cloner
2. Pick up any occupied slot to pick up the artifact
3. Swap the artifact with the target Pokemon then place it down in an empty slot
4. (Repeat) Pick up any occupied slot to pick up the target Pokemon then place it down in an empty slot

To see the clones, change to another screen and back.

### Decloning

1. Multi-select 2+ slots with the yellow glove ending over an empty slot or bad egg
2. Swap the selection with a cloner
3. Place the cloner back down if needed

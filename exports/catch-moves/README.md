## Catch moves

Catch moves change a battle to wild when the fight menu is opened.

The opposing Pokemon can now be caught, registered in the Pokedex, then sent to the PC as a bad egg.

The run option may work too. Both catching and running will count as a vicory.

### Marowak ghost

Running from the Marowak ghost does not remove the event. Catching the Marowak ghost also does not remove the event, but catches the opposing Marowak (nicknamed "GHOST") and registers it in the Pokedex.

Knocking out the Marowak ghost removes the event without the need for the Silph Scope.

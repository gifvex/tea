## Lickitung egg

The Lickitung egg is a mail glitch setup that takes advantage of Marc's known personality value and OT ID to decrypt the egg to any species 1-251.

### Setup (FireRed)

1. Trade for L35 Marc (Knock Off / Stomp / Wrap / Disable)
2. Teach Attract over Knock Off (TM45 from Route 24)
3. PP up x5: Stomp x1, Wrap x3, Disable x1
4. HP up x9
5. Iron x3
6. Calcium x5

Then three mail glitches:

**After each one,** pick up and put down the Lickitung egg in the PC.

1. Word 2+4: LACKS + HAHAHA (switched works too)
2. Word 1+3: GO AHEAD + IMMUNITY (switched works too)
3. Word 1+3: IMMUNITY + GO AHEAD (opposite of #2)

### Usage

Now the Lickitung egg can xor to any Kanto/Johto species and will have 0 egg cycles.

For 1-127, change EVs to general and xor 0x5A to the species.

For 128-251, change attacks to general and xor 0xD5 to the species.
